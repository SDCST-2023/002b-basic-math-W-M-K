##### Task 7
Read through the file **example1.py** for information on using the math module.
* Open the file called a7.py
* The program has a variable called F that will store a float value for the temperature in degrees Fahreneight
* Set F to a value of 62.5
* Do a calculation that converts the temperature to degrees C and stores it in a variable called C
* Round the temperature in C to 1 decimal place and print the result
* You will require the use of the round() function from example1.py
